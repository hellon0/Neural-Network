# Neural-Network
Tileable and trainable neural network only using numpy. Made to understand how neural networks train and feed information both forward and backwards. Made alongside a tutorial, but recreated from memory after using the tutorial. NNFS is used to create datasets if desired, but is ultimately unused in this commit.
